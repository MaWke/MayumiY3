#### READ IT!
This program is not perfect. It was made purely for the purpose of learning.
You can use it in any way you'd like, I used a lot of time on this, but it's 
most likely not very good, and there are some flaws and wrong inferences that I'm well aware of.
I chose to use this GUI library because I've read the first three parts of 
"Bjarne Stroustrup's Programming Principles and Practices Using C++", and
I believe that it's a good library for learning the fundamentals of using a GUI.
The modifications to the GUI and the new MainWindow class are made very poorly, so you shouldn't bother reading them.
This is the first program that I have made, though I have read a lot of other csgo
source codes and experimented with them. If you use these you will most likely not be banned for a while, 
Because I doubt anyone will actually use these. The settings are currently so bad that I personally wouldn't. 
Might update these if anybody cares for an update. If I keep updating I'll switch to Dear ImGUI. 
But I think I'm more interested in other projects, which might include csgo cheats. 
If you're working on a project or have an idea and need help I would be happy to help to the best of my ability.
If you have the time and knowledge I would appreciate if you went through some of the code and
made comments about it, I'm interested in learning your thoughts on what I could've done better.
I tried to make everything as simple as possible, though I'm not sure I succeeded.
